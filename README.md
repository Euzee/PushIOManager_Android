## PushIOManager for Android 

* [Integration Guide](http://docs.push.io)

## Release Notes
### Upgrading PushIO SDK 6.29.1 to 6.31
#### Minimum Android SDK Version 
- PushIO SDK now requires minimum SDK version of 14 (Ice Cream Sandwich). So remember to update your modules' `build.gradle` file,
```
    android {
      defaultConfig {
         minSdkVersion 14
      }
    }
```
#### GCM Update
- The internal GCM implementation has been updated to not conflict with other libraries using GCM within your app. As part of this change, you are required to declare the following services under the `<application>` tag in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
```xml
   <application>
    <service android:name="com.pushio.manager.PIOGCMRegistrationIntentService"
        android:exported="false"/>
    <service
        android:name="com.pushio.manager.PIOInstanceIDListenerService"
        android:exported="false">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.android.gms.iid.InstanceID" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>
   </application>
```
- Also, as part of this update, the following libraries are now required in the `dependencies` section of your modules' `build.gradle` file. 
```
dependencies {
  compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:10.2.0'
  compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:10.2.0'
}
```
#### GCM Update - Troubleshooting 
If you followed the above steps and registration was successful but have not received any push notifications since upgrading the PushIO SDK, 
- Verify that your Google project has been correctly imported into Firebase. If you have not yet done that, you will need to migrate your GCM project from Google Cloud to Firebase as Firebase is the recommended platform for Cloud Messaging going forward.
- Try changing the Server Key to the new format as generated by Firebase. 
  - In the Firebase console, select your project, click the Settings menu icon (the icon that resembles a gear), then choose 'Project Settings' and under 'Cloud Messaging' tab, you should see the new format `Server Key` along with the old Server Key.
  - Copy the new Server Key and add it to the PushIO/RI dashboard as shown in section [1.2] of our Step-by-Step guides (http://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFA/android/step-by-step/, http://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/android/step-by-step/)
